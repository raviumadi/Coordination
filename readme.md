## Summary

In this study, we investigated how the phyllostomid bat *Phyllostomus discolor* flexibly coordinates its sonar beam and ear receiver system during echolocation. Using synchronised 3D ear tracking, microphone array beam measurements, and 3D-printed ear models, we demonstrate that the emitter and receiver systems operate in a partially decoupled manner. Vertical ear movements are more synchronised, while horizontal ear postures show greater flexibility, suggesting independent control of spatial sampling strategies. The accompanying HRTF analyses illustrate how ear morphodynamics modulate spatial hearing sensitivity. This dual flexibility may be key to adaptive sensory performance in complex foraging environments.
